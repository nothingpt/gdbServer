# GDB Server

 GraphQL server for issue tracking

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

should have node.js (I use v9.5.0) + npm/yarn


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

run 'npm install' to install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

And then run 'npm start' to start the server

```
npm start
```

## Version

 * This version only reads/writes to an array. On the next commits, I will change that to a mongodb Database for persistense.
 * Soon will be deployed a GDB Client which uses a react frontend to access the server.
